# S1/S2 architecture

In robotics, the "S1/S2 architecture" refers to a dual-system approach inspired by the "System 1 / System 2" reasoning from cognitive science. System 1 (S1) handles fast, reactive, and low-level control, while System 2 (S2) manages slower, more deliberate, and higher-level reasoning. This architecture allows robots to combine the speed of reactive control with the cognitive capabilities of more complex reasoning systems. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
System 1 (S1):

    Fast and Reactive: S1 is designed for quick responses to immediate situations, often based on pre-programmed behaviors or simple sensor inputs.
    Low-Level Control: It focuses on controlling the robot's actuators and sensors to perform basic actions, like moving a joint or avoiding an obstacle.
    Examples: Obstacle avoidance, following a line, simple grasping tasks. 

System 2 (S2):

    Slow and Deliberative:
    S2 handles more complex tasks that require planning, reasoning, and learning.
    High-Level Reasoning:
    It involves tasks like path planning, object recognition, and goal selection.
    Examples:
    Planning a complex manipulation task, navigating a room, learning a new skill. 

How they interact:

    In an S1/S2 architecture, S1 acts as a safety net, providing immediate responses to unexpected events, while S2 handles the overall task and provides guidance to S1.
    S2 might, for example, plan a path, and then S1 would execute the movements while monitoring for obstacles. If S1 encounters an unexpected obstacle, it can alert S2 or temporarily deviate from the planned path until S2 can reassess the situation. 

Benefits of S1/S2 Architecture:

    Increased Robustness:
    Combining reactive and deliberative control makes robots more robust to unexpected situations.
    Improved Efficiency:
    S1 handles routine tasks quickly, freeing up S2 to focus on more complex ones.
    Enhanced Adaptability:
    S2 can learn and adapt to new environments and tasks, while S1 provides immediate responses in those new situations. 

In essence, the S1/S2 architecture allows robots to combine the speed and reliability of reactive control with the intelligence and adaptability of deliberative reasoning, leading to more sophisticated and capable robotic systems.
